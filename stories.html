          <h3>The Red Veiltail</h3>
          <h3>by Meg Klepacz</h3>
      </div>
  <div class="story">
    <p>Now, everybody who lived on the Devil's Backbone knew of the Red Veiltail, and just because nobody had ever seen it did not mean it wasn’t real nor feared: and feared it was. It was said to be a creature of impossible height and as old as the glacier that carved out those winding roads that made up the Devil’s Backbone. Its fur was believed to be a dark, matted red, caked with the dried blood of its chosen prey. The Veiltail earned its namesake for the wiry, red netting that supposedly coats its tail like a ruby spider’s web. All this description, however, is merely just conjecture. Nobody had ever really seen the Veiltail and, through the imagery of the moniker, drew their own conclusions as to just what the monster’s ghastly visage could be. There are those both brave and stupid enough who traverse the Devil’s Backbone, riding their motorcycles at breakneck speed in the witching hour, hoping against all hope, or praying against it, to catch a glimpse.</p>
  <p>There is an old masonic lodge at the edge of the Devil’s Backbone’s roughest turns. The Hamilton County Small Range Pistols Society meets in the lodge biweekly and one of its more flakier members has made a drunken vow to hunt the Veiltail this autumn. As we near November, his time is running out and his stubborn friends of the Small Range Pistols Society will not let him forget his promise. </p>
  <p>Miles Lungmus was the proud owner of a 2003 Dyna Wide Glide and a platinum member of the Hamilton County Small Range Pistols Society. Miles' email address is mrmotorman@zoomtown.com. He has a tabby cat named Mr. Mischief though, Mr. Mischief is fairly well behaved and sedate. He likes to play video games, clean his bike, and when Mr. Mischief sits on top of his chest and purrs. Though he is in the Society, Miles does not have access to any Small Range Pistols, his father thinks he is too dumb to use them and his mother thinks he is too smart. At nineteen, he is the youngest member of the Pistols Society and, as it so often happens when you are the youngest, he is the butt of many, many jokes. And what is worse than that, is that his father is a prominent member of the Pistols Society, a fact he never lets his youngest son forget. At this most recent meeting, this fact is brought to his attention for the umpteenth time. </p>
  <p>“Miles, you ain’t gonna let your daddy find the Veiltail before you do, ain’t ya?” asks Dennis Haussler. </p>
  <p>“Uh, yeah. Of course I am, gonna probably uh go out tonight on my bike and poke around,” Miles replies. In truth, Miles forgot all about his vow to hunt the Veiltail. How is he supposed to remember all the things he says he’s gonna do but won’t? That’s an impossible task. </p>
  <p>“He’s lying to you, Haussler! He’s too much of a sissy to even go five over the speed limit on his precious bike,” says Mr. Lungmus, clapping his son’s back hard enough to make the thin-framed Miles rock in place as if he was a bell that had been rung. The men laugh, some smoking, others cleaning their pistols with as much tenderness as if they held a newborn baby. Miles takes a drink of his warm IPA and grabs a pistol, he waves it over his head, as if in rebellion.</p>
  <p>“I’ll go now! I’ll go now and, and I’ll bring back the tail of the Veiltail and I’ll wear it around like one of those goddamn furries and maybe then, maybe then you’ll all shut up!”</p>
  <p>“Well, that’s more like it!” says Dennis.</p>
  <p>“He’s got bite, who knew?” says Glenn Schooley.</p> 
  <p>“You come back wearing a tail around your waist, I’ll be the one shooting you,” says Mr. Lungmus.</p> 
<p>Miles rolled his eyes and was off. </p>
